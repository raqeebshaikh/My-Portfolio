I have reffered the project from andrew@githut on how the SkipGram Word2vec embedding words and added my Cbow Word3vec Model . 
Additions made to this project are :
Cosine Similarity
Eucledian Distance
Cbow 

The Project has not been trained on any big dataset but just to give a basic understanding on how the Word Embedding work . There are many pretrainded word Embedding model trained on huge datasets which can be used on your project 
Word2Vec
Glove 

Below in the Sample on how the code manages to find the similarity based on the context word .
